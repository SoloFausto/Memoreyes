### MemorEyes

# What MemorEyes Does
MemorEyes scans a photo of notes uploaded by the user, and creates flashcards of important (underlined) words and their definitions.

# How MemorEyes Does That
Once the photo is uploaded, MemorEyes used OCR (Optical Character Recongnition) so the program can understand the text present in the photo. Then, MemorEyes uses ChatGPT 4o to sort the terms and their definitions onto the flashcards. 

# The Team
MemorEyes was created for the GateHacks '24 hackathon by Colgate University students. 

# Future Updates
The list below has some of the changes we would like to add to MemorEyes:
- Better optimization
- Mobile app for iOS and Android
- More aesthetic UI
- User accounts that let users save flashcard sets
